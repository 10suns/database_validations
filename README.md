# DatabaseValidations

ActiveRecord provides validations on app level but this won't guarantee the 
consistent. In some cases, like `validates_uniqueness_of` it even executes 
additional SQL query to our database each time we're saving the record what 
is not very efficient. 

The main goal of the gem is to provide compatibility between DB constraints 
and ActiveRecord validation with better performance and consistency.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'database_validations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install database_validations

## validate_db_uniqueness_of

### Usage

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_db_uniqueness_of :email
end

original = User.create(email: 'email@mail.com')
dupe = User.create(email: 'email@mail.com')
# => false
dupe.errors.messages
# => {:email=>["has already been taken"]}
User.create!(email: 'email@mail.com')
# => ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid Validation failed: email has already been taken
```

**Note**: keep in mind, we don't check uniqueness validity through `valid?` method.
```ruby
original = User.create(email: 'email@mail.com')
dupe = User.new(email: 'email@mail.com')
dupe.valid?
# => true
dupe.save
# => false 
dupe.errors.messages
# => {:email=>["has already been taken"]} 
```

### Configuration options

We want to support full compatibility with existing `validates_uniqueness_of` validator. 

- `scope`: One or more columns by which to limit the scope of the uniqueness constraint.
- `message`: Specifies a custom error message (default is: "has already been taken").
- `conditions`: Specify the conditions to be included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment to 
limit the uniqueness constraint lookup (e.g. <tt>conditions: -> { where(status: 'active') }</tt>).
- `case_sensitive`: Looks for an exact match. Ignored by non-text columns (+true+ by default).
- `allow_nil`: If set to +true+, skips this validation if the attribute is +nil+ (default is +false+).
- `allow_blank`: If set to +true+, skips this validation if the attribute is blank (default is +false+).
- `if`: Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the validation should occur 
(e.g. <tt>if: :allow_validation</tt>, or <tt>if: Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step > 2 }</tt>). The method,
proc or string should return or evaluate to a `true` or `false` value.
- `unless`: Specifies a method, proc or string to call to determine if the validation should not 
occur (e.g. <tt>unless: :skip_validation</tt>, or <tt>unless: Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step <= 2 }</tt>). 
The method, proc or string should return or evaluate to a `true` or `false` value.

**Note**: only few options are supported now: `scope`.

### Benchmark

<provide a benchmark here>

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for 
an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then 
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
